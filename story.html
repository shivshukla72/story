             <p>A <span class="firsts">Null</span> was making fun of the <span class="second"><u>Null</u></span> one day for being so slow.</p>
               
              <p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>

              <p>"<span class="response">NUll</span>" replied the <span class="firsts">NUll</span>" and I get there <span class="speed">NUll</span> than you think I'll run you a race and prove it."</p>

             <div class="first">
              <p>The <span class="firsts">NUll</span> was much <span class="adj">NUll</span> at the idea of running a race with <span class="firsts">NUll</span>, but for the thing he agreed, So the <span class="third">NUll</span>, who had consented to act as judge , marked the distance yelled, <span class="quote">NUll</span> </p>

                 <p>The <span class="firsts">NUll</span> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <span class="second">NUll</span>
                    feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him  to try a race with a <span class="firsts">NUll</span>, he went off the 
                   course to practice <span class="verb">NUll</span> for <span class="number"></span> hours until the <span class="second">NUll</span> should catch up</p>

                    <p>The <span class="second"  >NUll</span> meanwhile kept going slowly byt steadily, and after a time, passed the place where the <span class="firsts">NUll</span> was <span class="verb">NUll</span> , The<span class="firsts">NUll</span> was so caught up in <span class="verb">NUll</span>; and when at last he did stop , the <span class="second"> was near the goal. The <u>null</u> was so caught up in was near the goal. The <span class="firsts">NUll</span> now ran his swiftest ,but he could not overtake the<span class="second">NUll</span> in time.</p>
